= How can I get help if I have any issues? =
For issues with your WooCommerce installation you should use the support forum here on wordpress.org. For other issues you should contact PayFlexi.

= Why are orders put pending and not completed? =
When an instalment payment is made on an order, PayFlexi will update the order status to pending since the payment is not yet completed. As the customer continues to make payment, the total amount paid will change. Once the instalment payment is complete, the order status will change to "Processing" or "Complete".

PayFlexi continues to update the order status via the webhook. So ensure you copy the webhook from your WooCommerce settings page to your PayFlexi settings page.
